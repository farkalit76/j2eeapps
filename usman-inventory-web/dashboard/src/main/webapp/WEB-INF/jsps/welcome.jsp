        <h1>What is an Inventory System</h1>
        <p width="50%">
            An inventory system combines desktop software, bar-code scanners, bar-code labels, 
            and mobile devices to streamline the tracking of inventory (e.g. consumables, goods, 
            SKUs, supplies, etc.) as product flows through a warehouse environment. <br/>
            This could be a single stockroom or multiple warehouses spread across the country.
        </p>

        <h1>How Inventory Control</h1>
        <p width="50%">
            At its core, inventory control works by tracking two main functions of your stockroom 
            or warehouse — receiving (incoming) and shipping (outgoing). There's other actions 
            that take place such as movement, or relocating, of inventory, as well as in 
            manufacturing situations raw materials are decremented and finished goods get incremented. 
            The act of performing physical inventory counts is another input to an inventory system that
            allows it to accurately keep track of inventory levels.
        </p>

        <h1> Common Inventory Applications </h1>

        <ul>
            <li>Warehouses</li>
            <li>Stockrooms and supply rooms</li>
            <li>Distribution</li>
            <li>Offices and classrooms</li>
            <li>Facilities management</li>
            <li>Light manufacturing</li>
            <li>Work-In-Progress</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Popular System Functionality</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Print barcode labels</li>
            <li>Create purchase orders</li>
            <li>Receive, relocate</li>
            <li>Create sales orders</li>
            <li>Pick/Issue, dispose</li>
            <li>Physical inventory counts and cycle counts</li>
            <li>Create, run, schedule and share reports</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Benefits of an inventory system</h2>
     
        <p >The goal of inventory control is to accurately know current inventory levels 
            and minimize understock and overstock situations. Whether you are tracking inventory 
            used to perform a service or sold to customers, a barcode inventory solution provides 
            staff accountability and minimizes inventory stockouts and shrinkage. By efficiently 
            tracking quantities across stocking locations you’ll have insight and be able to make smarter
            inventory decisions. An inventory system provides the necessary knowledge both for the warehouse 
            worker to perform daily tasks and management to have product and financial insight.</p>
